# THREAT ACTORS
---------------

* Introduction
--------------
In this lesson, we’ll be looking at some common types of threat actors. We’ll discuss some of their attributes, and what makes them unique or dangerous. In general, we’ll start with less 
dangerous types of threat actors, and move on to more dangerous types.

Before we begin, let’s talk about a type of threat actor we won’t be going over: Individual Hackers. Hackers are people too, and they have widely varied personalities, motivations, and 
skill sets. There is no single profile that can fit all individual hackers without being incredibly vague. Generally speaking, hackers are categorized into ethical (white-hat), malicious 
(black-hat), and semi-ethical (gray-hat) depending on the actions they take.

We also won’t be discussing APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) as a type of their own: An APT is simply a threat actor that has advanced capabilities and is difficult to dissuade. If it 
takes 6 months to compromise a target, then they’ll spend 6 months working on it.

* Human Error
-------------
One of the most common threat actors isn’t some shadowy hacker group, but the potential to make mistakes that lies in every one of us! Even though these mistakes aren’t intentionally 
malicious, they still represent an (abstract) threat actor that should be considered when designing systems. Human error doesn’t have any specific targets or objectives - it can strike 
anytime and anywhere that humans are involved, “attacking” through unpredictable means and with unpredictable results.

Protecting against human error means designing processes and systems in ways where it is impossible (or at least very difficult) for mistakes to have a serious impact. We see this in 
Murphy’s Law: if it’s possible to do something incorrectly, someone will do it incorrectly. Human error has caused data breaches, civil engineering disasters, airplane crashes, industrial 
accidents, and much, much more.

Human error can be both external and internal and includes any action that can be done by a human. Human error has whatever access has been granted to the human making the error, but very 
little sophistication. For example, multi-step mistakes are less likely than very simple errors. Human error has no specific targets, as well as no “negative” motivation, as the humans 
making the errors are often trying NOT to make errors!

* Script Kiddies
-----------------
Script Kiddies is a term that refers to inexperienced hackers who lack experience, as well as have a low understanding of hacking and the tools used to do it. They make use of already 
existing hacking tools and scripts, without understanding the underlying vulnerabilities that are being exploited. The word “kiddie”, usually used to refer to a small child, is instead 
used to represent their lack of sophistication.

Script kiddies are usually opportunistic in their targeting, and often hack just for the sake of hacking, rather than achieving some premeditated objective. However, this lack of planning 
or high-level motivation doesn’t mean script kiddies are harmless!

Modern hacking tools are easy to acquire, configure, and use, and the vast majority of vulnerabilities that get exploited in real-world scenarios are known vulnerabilities for which 
exploits have been developed and distributed.

Script kiddies are almost always external threats, with low sophistication and resources. They often have minimal or no funding, and only freely available resources. Their goals can vary, 
but they usually operate opportunistically and don’t have a great deal of motivation. Once a script kiddie has been stopped by security measures, they’re likely to move on to an easier 
target.

* Insider Threats
-----------------
Insider threats are threat actors operating within an organization. Insider threats are usually employees but contractors or ex-employees can be considered insider threats too.

Insider threats can have a variety of goals, such as financial gain, personal grievances, or gaining some sort of advantage over others. Insider threats can operate opportunistically or 
deliberately, sometimes working with other threat actors to give them access they would not have otherwise had.

Insider threats usually have elevated access and increased knowledge when compared to external threat actors. This can make them more difficult to detect, and it can give them more 
options for how to attack the organization. Insider threats can have a wide range of sophistication - A disgruntled cashier, for example, will probably not be as sophisticated a threat as 
a disgruntled security analyst.

Insider threats are one reason why it’s so important to follow the principle of least privilege! Limiting the access insiders have means that a malicious insider will have fewer options 
available to them, and can do less damage.

One specific type of insider threat is that of Shadow IT. Shadow IT refers to assets that are part of an organization’s network, but aren’t set up or managed by IT AND that IT and 
Security are not aware of. This can be dangerous since unknown assets on an organization’s network can create attack vectors that the organization is not aware of until it’s too late.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Hacker Groups
---------------
Before we move on to “scarier” threat actors, we need to discuss the generic concept of a “hacker group”. Hacker groups are, as the name suggests, groups of hackers. This is a very broad 
term, and it can refer to everything from a group of friends who like tinkering with game consoles to state-sponsored threat groups.

Many of the types of threat actors we will soon discuss also operate as groups, but there are plenty of groups that don’t fit cleanly into any one category. These “leftover” groups can 
have a staggering variety of sophistication, resources, goals, and motivations, without necessarily having a clearly defined set of tactics.

One hacker group might be for people interested in hacking Bluetooth devices, for example, while another group might be loosely-knit groups of individuals, all with their own style, who 
like to show off their work to each other.

Some groups might operate opportunistically, while others might focus on a specific target with a long-term objective in mind, though these objectives aren’t always “reasonable”. There 
has been at least one documented case of a hacker group compromising a game developer because… well, they just wanted to play an early version of an upcoming game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Hacktivists
-------------
Hacktivists are hackers with an ideology, who strongly believe in a cause and are willing to break the law to further that cause.

Hacktivists are defined by their strong motivation; this motivation means that they can be very difficult to dissuade from a target. If one method doesn’t work, they will just try 
different approaches until something works.

Hacktivists can have a wide variety of objectives that they aim to achieve via hacking. Defacement, denial of service, and leaking confidential information are all common actions taken by 
hacktivists.

Hacktivists are usually external threats, and they can have a range of sophistication and resources. Their goals are usually in service to whatever cause they are rallying behind. The 
most dangerous aspect of hacktivist groups is their motivation. Many of these groups have goals that seem noble on paper. For example, revealing corruption or freeing someone being held 
against their will by an ethically dubious hospital, and it can be easy to see why these hackers would feel strongly enough to take matters into their own hands.

* Competitors
-------------
Corporate espionage has existed since at least the 1700s, and the digital era has made it easier than ever for unscrupulous organizations to steal trade secrets or sabotage rivals in 
order to gain an unfair advantage. Competitors have been trying to steal secrets from others for centuries.

Corporate espionage is usually illegal, so organizations that engage or attempt to engage in it will likely focus on secrecy and deniability. This means that the tactics they use will 
probably be more sophisticated than usual, in an attempt to evade detection and attribution. Additionally, corporations often have large pools of resources (financial, personnel, etc) 
that can be leveraged by attackers on their behalf.

Most suspected cases of corporate espionage revolve around the theft (or attempted theft) of trade secrets - rival corporations probably don’t have a good reason to steal a password 
database, for example. The threat actor’s motivation is likely higher than average, as they will be focusing on competitors, but they may be unwilling to overextend and leave themselves 
vulnerable to detection.

Corporate espionage is primarily external but may incorporate internal elements in the form of rogue employees, or agents working for the threat actor.

* Organized Cybercrime
----------------------
Organized cybercrime generally has a single overarching goal: Money. Financial fraud, data theft, extortion, trafficking, and so much more. If you can think of an underhanded way to make 
money with computers, there’s probably a group of cybercriminals doing it.

These cybercriminals usually represent an external threat, with a wide range of sophistication. Some groups might be relatively inexperienced, while others might be experienced hackers. 
Likewise, the resources these groups have access to can vary, but they are likely to be higher than what a single person could muster.

Cybercrime can be both opportunistic and targeted - If there’s a way for them to make money, they’ll probably start taking advantage of it sooner or later. Here’s a brief list of some 
things one group, named REvil, did in 2020 and 2021:

	. Stole A terabyte of data from a law firm, then attempted to extort, among others, Madonna and Lady Gaga.
	. Attacked a trust that ran schools in the UK, and held stolen data for ransom, along with student’s coursework.
	. Stole plans for upcoming Apple products and tried to hold them for ransom.
	. Attacked a meatpacking company with ransomware, extorting 11 million dollars in bitcoin.
	. Targeted an energy company with ransomware.
	. Stole documents from a Florida-based military contractor.
