# MALWARE

* Introduction to Malware
-------------------------
It’s your first day on the job at Cybercademy — a new cybersecurity organization that helps companies improve their security practices.

Your Task
Identify various types of malware on an infected device and provide suggestions to the client on how they can prevent this from happening in the future.

But first, what is malware? Malware is malicious hardware, firmware, or software inserted into a system to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to a network. Any type of malware can 
greatly compromise the security principles of Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability.

Throughout this lesson, you will learn how each type of malware gets into a system, what it does, and a short suggestion for how to be cautious against this form of malware.

* Adware
--------
First, you open the web browser. The first page it opens to is a strange page about a computer cleaner that’s “guaranteed to make your computer run 10X faster!!”. What an odd choice for a 
homepage.

As you navigate the web, you notice lots of ads popping up all over the place. There are so many popping up on your screen that it’s actually slowing down the webpage and increasing page 
load times.

It’s clear this computer has adware. Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements on your screen. While not overly malicious on the surface, sometimes adware can come 
bundled with other, more harmful malware.

With enough adware on your machine, this could become a real performance issue.

* Your Suggestion
-----------------
	. You tell your client to make sure to not click on any strange links or download any untrustworthy files.
	. A trustworthy antivirus software could also help with this issue.
